# eco - another mern e-commerce app.

In order not to ðŸ’¤ fall asleep standing up I decided to make my fingers happy ðŸ˜Ž and write an eCommerce application.

I thought about what backend language to use, it's wonderful that I have the option to choose, c# php and python were on the agenda but in the end I chose my first love Javascript and decided to write it with node, I don't feel like writing another monolithic application for many reasons, so I decided to break everything down into small pieces and write microservices that in general will respond to the application even if it competes with Amazon or Ali Express in the future.

Regarding the frontend I will probably stay in my comfort zone and choose React even though Angular And Vue definitely winks at me and tempts me, in short I'm pretty sure it will be fun and exciting and I wish myself happy coding.

Deep down I fill I'm going to ðŸŒŸðŸŽ‰enjoyðŸŽ‰ðŸŒŸ, hope you too!
