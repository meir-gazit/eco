# eco - another mern e-commerce app.

In order not to ðŸ’¤ fall asleep standing up I decided to make my fingers happy ðŸ˜Ž and write an eCommerce application.

I thought about what backend language to use, it's wonderful that I have the option to choose, c# php and python were on the agenda but in the end I chose my first love Javascript and decided to write it with node, I don't feel like writing another monolithic application for many reasons, so I decided to break everything down into small pieces and write microservices that in general will respond to the application even if it competes with Amazon or Ali Express in the future.

Regarding the frontend I will probably stay in my comfort zone and choose React even though Angular And Vue definitely winks at me and tempts me, in short I'm pretty sure it will be fun and exciting and I wish myself happy coding.

Here are some thing I thought  to do while coding to ðŸš€ enhance my development process and the overall success of of this ecom app:

1. **Microservices Best Practices:**
   - Ensure each microservice has a well-defined purpose and responsibility.
   - Use API gateways to manage communication between microservices.
   - Implement proper error handling and logging across microservices.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Design your microservices to scale independently.
   - Consider implementing load balancing and caching mechanisms.
   - Monitor and analyze performance regularly to identify potential bottlenecks.

3. **Containerization and Orchestration:**
   - Use Docker for containerization to ensure consistency across environments.
   - Explore Kubernetes for orchestration, making it easier to manage, deploy, and scale your microservices.

4. **Security:**
   - Implement secure coding practices.
   - Utilize HTTPS for secure communication.
   - Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

5. **Testing:**
   - Embrace a robust testing strategy, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
   - Implement automated testing to catch issues early in the development process.

6. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Use monitoring tools to keep track of application health and performance.
   - Implement centralized logging to facilitate troubleshooting and debugging.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation for your APIs and microservices.
   - Include guides for developers on how to use and contribute to your codebase.

8. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.
   - Ensure that your deployments are rollback-ready in case of issues.

9. **User Experience (UX) and Performance:**
   - Prioritize a user-friendly interface for your eCommerce application.
   - Optimize frontend performance to provide a smooth user experience.

10. **Community and Collaboration:**
    - Engage with the developer community for support and insights.
    - Consider open-sourcing parts of your project to encourage collaboration.

11. **Adaptability:**
    - Stay informed about the latest technologies and best practices.
    - Be ready to adapt your architecture and tools as your application evolves.

12. **Backup and Recovery:**
    - Implement regular backups and test the recovery process.
    - Have a disaster recovery plan in place.

So even I wrote "just another mern e-commerce app" at the begining, deep down I fill I'm going to ðŸŒŸðŸŽ‰enjoyðŸŽ‰ðŸŒŸ, hope you too!
